We’re excited to announce that 4Geeks Academy, through our partnership with ManaTech, has been invited to attend the **America Business Forum (ABF)** in Miami as a **community partner**. The event will take place on **November 5–6** and marks an important step in our ongoing mission to expand access to tech education worldwide.

The invitation highlights our impact on tech education and innovation, and reinforces our shared commitment with ManaTech to strengthen Miami’s growing tech ecosystem and empower the next generation of digital creators.

The ABF brings together more than **40,000 business leaders, policymakers, and innovators** for two days of dialogue, inspiration, and opportunity. This year’s guest list features some of the most influential figures shaping the future of business, technology, and culture — from **Jamie Dimon** and **Eric Schmidt** to **Will Smith**, **Lionel Messi**, and **Donald J. Trump**.

For 4Geeks, this opportunity is more than recognition — it’s a chance to amplify our impact and share our vision of a future where accessible, high-quality tech education drives real innovation and opportunity.

We’re proud to represent our community — students, mentors, and partners — on a global stage that celebrates leadership and transformation. Together with ManaTech, we look forward to connecting with visionary leaders, forging new collaborations, and continuing to position Miami as a hub for talent, innovation, and growth.

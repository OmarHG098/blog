### The Tech Job Market Has Changed—Have You?

AI isn’t taking all the jobs—but it is changing the rules.

Recruiters now use AI to scan résumés and auto-reject candidates before a human ever sees them.

Interviews are recorded, scored, and analyzed by algorithms.

Hiring platforms prioritize candidates who can communicate clearly, show adaptability, and demonstrate emotional intelligence—things AI can’t fake.

In other words, it's no longer just about what you know. It’s about how you present yourself across every step of the hiring process: from your résumé to the final interview.

That’s where a lot of bootcamps stop short.

But we built **GeekFORCE** to prepare you for both sides of the hiring equation:

- The technical and AI literacy to build projects and pass challenges.
- The human and strategic skills to stand out on paper, in interviews, and on AI-driven platforms.

### How GeekFORCE Prepares You for the New Hiring Landscape

At 4Geeks, we recognize that the hiring process is no longer just a human process. It’s a **human-AI hybrid**, and we train you for that from day one.

### 🔍 Résumé Optimization for the AI Age

First things first: your résumé needs to pass the bots before it reaches a human.

Through GeekFORCE, we help you:

- Structure your résumé for **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** by using proven formats and keyword strategies.
- Use **prompt templates** to customize your résumé quickly for different roles—what used to take hours now takes minutes.
- Work one-on-one with our career advisors to ensure that your final résumé still reflects you, not just a string of keywords.
- Use **Rigobot**, our in-house AI assistant built exclusively for 4Geeks students, to help streamline your profile building, résumé writing, and LinkedIn optimization.

It’s not just about beating the algorithm—it’s about using it to your advantage.

We also teach our students to think differently: AI isn’t the enemy—it’s a **tool**. One you can use strategically and ethically to become a stronger candidate.

### 🤖 Preparing for AI‑Influenced Interviews

Live whiteboard interviews and coding challenges haven’t disappeared, but they’ve evolved.

Many companies now include:

- AI-assisted take-home challenges
- Recorded interviews scored by algorithms
- Live interviews where the use of AI tools (like Copilot) is allowed or expected

We prepare our students to thrive in these settings by:

- Encouraging **ethical AI use** in technical projects and interview practice
- Teaching them how to clearly articulate their logic and process—even when AI was part of the solution
- Running **mock interviews** that simulate real-world conditions using an AI-powered platform, with feedback customized to your role, experience level, and industry

This approach helps students gain confidence and clarity. They know when it’s okay to use AI, how to discuss it honestly, and how to still demonstrate their own thinking and skills in the process.

> “Many companies allow candidates to use AI tools during live interviews to mimic real-world scenarios. So we coach students to be honest about when and how they used AI—and to focus on showing their decision-making and adaptability. It’s not just about getting the answer. It’s about how you get there.”

### 💬 Showing What AI Can’t: Your Mindset, Motivation, and Adaptability

The technical test is only part of the picture. What hiring managers are really watching for in junior candidates is:

- How you approach a challenge
- How you deal with uncertainty or errors
- How well you communicate your process and decisions

We help students build the confidence and clarity to show exactly that.

> “Sometimes interviewers don’t even expect you to fully solve the challenge. They want to see how you face the problem—your mindset, how you react, how confident and flexible you are. We coach students to show that. To know that they do know what they need to know, and that they bring motivation, adaptability, and fresh perspectives as juniors.”
>

In short, we train you to show what AI can’t:

- Human insight
- Emotional intelligence
- Curiosity and coachability

Those are the things that make hiring managers take notice—and they’re often what separates you from other candidates, especially when everyone has similar technical skills.

### 🧠 Real Mentorship Meets AI Efficiency

Here’s what you get:

- Unlimited 1:1 mentorship from real industry professionals—even long after you graduate

- Instant feedback on your performance plus follow-up support from career coaches
- Expert guidance on how to get the best out of AI to customize your resume and profile
- Help with job search strategy, salary negotiation, portfolio building, and finding remote roles

We believe that AI should make mentoring **more efficient—not replace it**.

That’s why we keep the human touch in everything we do, even as we evolve with new technology.

> “We’ve added AI literacy to our interview prep, and we’re currently testing a platform that generates customized mock interviews. But we will always keep the one-on-one human touch. We personally coach each student on how to talk through their logic, handle mistakes, and demonstrate resilience.”

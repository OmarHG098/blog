### 1. Profile Optimization

You’ll rebuild your:

- LinkedIn so it attracts recruiters like magnets
- Résumé to speak “ATS”—a.k.a. the language of hiring algorithms
- GitHub with polished projects that show you're more than just bootcamp-certified

💡 *Insider tip: We teach you how to brand yourself like a developer who belongs at Google—even if you’ve never written code before 4Geeks.*

You don’t just memorize answers—you **build confidence**.

- Personalized job search strategies based on your goals
- Warm intros to companies we partner with (Microsoft, Facebook, Evernote, Telefónica, and more)
